00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.759
Welcome to the video on how to use the

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.920
medical encyclopedia to get started. This is

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.360
the main page, which can also be called an index. Here you can

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.799
select the style you like the most or

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.320
that best suits your needs.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.640
Among them are the night style,

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.640
the high contrast style,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.840
and finally, a style that

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.840
provides more

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.520
accessibility. Once the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.000
desired style is selected, you can navigate through the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.680
web page. The first thing we see is a

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.399
search bar that allows you to make a direct search

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.800
by filling out the desired fields.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.440
From this same page, it is

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.480
possible to demonstrate that from any of

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.840
the pages on the website, you can return

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.399
to the index by clicking on the logo in the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.480
header. You can also see where

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.120
you are by looking at the breadcrumbs and

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.199
returning to any previous pages by

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.719
clicking on them.

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.400
Another way to navigate faster on the web is to access the site map

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.840
available in the footer. In it, you can

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.520
see all the content you can access to continue.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.000
We will return to the main page, where there are

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.320
certain featured articles and access to forms.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.479
Another way to consult information about diseases

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.600
is by selecting the initial letter. If you select a letter with no diseases,

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.119
an error will appear. However, if you select a letter

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.000
that has diseases, the index with diseases

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.720
starting with that letter will open. By clicking on the disease of interest,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.399
you'll see information such as related images,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.759
description, causes, symptoms, tests,

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.149
treatment, expectations, and an embedded video

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.439
that also discusses the topic. Returning to the main page,

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.719
I'll cover additional available options.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.079
Besides viewing all diseases and their information,

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.600
there is an option to contact us through the contact form,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.039
whether to ask a question, file a complaint,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.640
or submit any other type of query.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.429
Another option is to indicate the level of satisfaction with the site

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.599
through the satisfaction form.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.879
Lastly, you can view the accessibility statement to see the measures

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.280
we have taken to make our website accessible.
